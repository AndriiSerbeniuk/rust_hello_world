# rust_hello_world
Simple rust program that compiles cpp code into a library and binds it into the project.

Useful links I used:
- https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/introduction.html - official guide to using bindgen. Steps worth attention in particular are steps 2 and 3.1.3;
- https://crates.io/crates/cc - cc crate link. Has a comprehensive guide on how to use it, right there on the page. The part about binding the generated library to rust didn't work for me though.
